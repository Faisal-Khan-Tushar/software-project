                COVID-19 PERSPECTIVE)</h5>
              <p><span id="first-text">I</span>n this paper, we looked at how cloud computing technology can be applied
                in the education
                settings. It
                has become an urgent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools, colleges and universities have
                been forced to provide online education. Cloud computing plays an ideal role here which lowers the IT
                costs of HEI. Cloud computing also provides an excellent platform for educators to improve their
                teaching practices and productivity. It can also motivate the students by following an experiential
                education approach, using unique gaming techniques or collaborative e-learning platforms. Cloud
                computing technology saves IT costs and also the energy output. Moreover, the same cloud
                infrastructure can be exploited by a several universities for the purposes of teaching, learning, and
                research at the same time by deploying an educational cloud model. We also looked at some of the
                challenges that the educational settings might face while deploying cloud computing models in their
                schools, colleges or universities.</p>

                low-cost information operation
                mode, the result of long-term development and accumulation of information technology, and the most
                profound change in IT industry since the Internet revolution. Cloud computing can realize the high
                sharing of information resources, meet the individualized e-learning needs of teachers and students,
                prevent viruses from invading, and reduce the work difficulty of managers. In the process of
                informatization construction in colleges and universities, cloud computing technology plays a key role
                in reducing capital consumption and ensuring the reliability of the campus network environment. The
                application of cloud computing provides powerful computing power and abundant information
                resources for learning and scientific research, which makes the work more convenient and efficient.
                At the same time, it also provides a new development path for educational management

              <p><span id="first-text">T</span>he economic growth of any country is usually maintained and enhanced by
                education in
                terms of quality and level. Cloud computing is an exciting development in today's education system.
                It offers students and the educational institutions access to different applications and resources at
                UtkalHistoricalResearchJournal, ISSN : 0976-2132 Vol.-34(XII), 93
                minimal costs. The flexible aspect of cloud computing relieves students from high maintenance on
                storing data, eliminating the factor of deletion of data, makes it more convenient to learn from
                anywhere.
                In this research an open ended question was raised about the current scenario on how to activate the
                role of cloud computing in higher education. It was found that out of (N=404) only (N=110)
                respondents have given their valuable suggestions. Further during the data cleaning process, few
                respondents have not provided the apt solution and hence only those which were meaningful were
                considered for the study . Most respondents suggested that access to high speed internet should be
                provided to the students and the higher education institutions. Safety and security measures must be
                taken with the data that is being used by the students.
                Cloud must be implemented and encouraged in the educational sector for better learning and
                technology driven education. Conducting workshops on how the cloud can be effective in learning
                and reaching out to maximum institutions especially in the remote areas, this will blend the
                education and technology in the best way possible. Through the results obtained in this survey, it
                was found that students are willing to use Cloud technology in learning due to the various benefits it
                offers. Modern education is changing as is an education in the classroom due to the advent of
                technology. Students expect and require more services from their institutions. The future success of a
                country depends on the development of the education given to its students. Cloud computing creates
                a universal platform with simplified scalability. Therefore, it will be vital for students and
                educational institutions who have not adopted cloud for the purpose of learning to shift to the cloud,
                to experience better and convenient avenue to information and technological services, especially the
                benefits and abilities, such as access to complex applications, minimal costs of cloud data storage,
                scalability and flexibility of an e-learning platform that is cloud computing enabled.</p>
